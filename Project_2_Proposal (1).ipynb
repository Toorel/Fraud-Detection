Nearly half of all Americans have experienced identity theft or some other form of financial fraud. This experience can be both personally violating and extraordinarily expensive. In 2020 financial losses to fraud totaled over $700 billion dollars. Beyond the economic losses experienced overall the effects of financial fraud individually can be devastating and can take years to recover from. Organizations and individuals alike need protection from these types of crimes and accurate prediction can save millions or even billions of dollars and provide peace of mind. Security breaches resulting in fraud have deleterious effects on the reputation of any organization especially when considering financial data where the utmost security is expected. For this reason in the organizational case the losses to financial fraud are twofold, not only are they financial losses in the form of fraudulent transactions but financial losses from potential customers who are wary due to reputational damage.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Fbd5fj5oJDRp"},"source":["**Type of Learning:**\n","\n","Supervised Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)\n","\n","Unsupervised learning (K Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Model Clustering)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6OMi7IJNJXZI"},"source":["\n","**Tasks, Experience and Performance Metric**\n","\n","***Task: Identify anomalous transactions as fraud***\n","\n","The task at hand is to by looking at features of a transaction be able to identify whether the transaction is fraudulent or not.\n","\n","***Experience: Review of many transactions***\n","\n","In considering fraud experience comes in the form of many transactions and since our dataset and indeed most datasets of transactions are unbalanced as most transactions are not fraud experience is very important. There needs to be a great number of transactions to identify fraud as maybe only 1 in every 100 is fraudulent.\n","\n","Since we have a provided label and will be using that label to make predictions this is a supervised learning task, but we additionally would like to cluster transactions to not only predict fraud but classify different types of fraud, therefore we will be utilizing both supervised and unsupervised learning methods to complete our analysis.\n","\n","Data preprocessing will be necessary to complete this task especially scaling as Logistic Regression and KNN algorithms both rely on distance metrics which in the dataset as is are highly variable between features. \n","\n","The first problem we encounter when attempting to predict fraud is our dataset is extremely unbalanced. The overwhelming majority of transactions are not fraudulent. Therefore to achieve the highest accuracy an algorithm would simply always predict 0. To solve this problem we will need to separate out all fraudulent transactions into a separate dataset and create a more even split between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.  To do so we will randomly sample two times the number of transactions from the legitimate transactions dataset and combine that with the fraudulent transactions dataset to create a better balance.\n","\n","***Performance: Sensitivity (How many fraudulent transactions can the model correctly predict)***\n","\n","Accuracy is not a useful performance metric for this dataset as simply predicting 0 for every transaction would be close to 99% accurate as the majority of transactions are not fraud. Instead we will focus on the algorithm's sensitivity as the true positive rate is the most important metric when measuring fraud. While there is some cost to false positives it is minor as a transaction being predicted as fraud while inconvenient is not particularly damaging for an individual or organization. \n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1fW9h7dsJ4bk"},"source":["**Structure of Dataset:**\n","\n","This financial fraud dataset is composed of over 6 millions transactions with 11 separate columns. \n","\n","step - maps a unit of time in the real world.

It is important we use a proper metric to measure model performance as not all mistakes are equal for fraud.  \n","Specifically false positives are much less costly than false negatives as missing fraud can be a significant failure for an organization and a terrible situation for an individual. Our assessment metrics will mirror this as we will use recall as the primary judge of our algorithms effectiveness. \n","\n","We will use an 80/20 test-train split on the rebalanced dataset and to prevent overfitting to our training split we will use k-fold cross validation sampling between k different segments of our training data for evaluation and hyperparameter tuning, before our final evaluation on the test set.\n","\n","We will use an ROC curve on the rebalanced dataset to compare the TPR and FPR as attempting to use an ROC curve on the original dataset would not be effective as there is a significant class imbalance. \n","\n","To assess our clusters we will try a number of different values of k, visualize the various clusters and provide some descriptive analysis of each individual cluster. \n"]}]}
